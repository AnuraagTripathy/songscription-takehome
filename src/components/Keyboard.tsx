 * A real keyboard, in two states.

 * At rest it is a survey: every key the piece ever touches is inked, so you can
 * see at a glance how much of the instrument you are being asked to cover. The
 * moment it plays, the survey clears and the keyboard becomes the performance —
 * only the notes actually sounding are lit, in the colour of the hand playing
 * them. Clay is the right hand, graphite the left, the same two leads the
 * drawing is pencilled in, so the two pictures teach the same thing.
