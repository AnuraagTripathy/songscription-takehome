 * The piece, pencilled in.
 *
 * Drawn the way you would pencil it into an exercise book: two leads, graphite
 * for the left hand and clay for the right, straight onto the squares. The
 * colour is not decoration. It is which hand plays the note, which is the one
 * thing about the shape a learner can act on.
 *
 * The hand comes from the file's own tracks wherever it has them. Rows written
 * before that was recorded fall back to the middle-C split, which is why a
 * figure that crosses middle C can still come out in two colours on them.
